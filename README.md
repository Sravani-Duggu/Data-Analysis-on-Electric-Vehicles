# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project
This project explores Electric Vehicle (EV) data through various data analysis and visualization techniques. The dataset provides insights into the distribution and growth of EVs across different regions, makes, and years. This project was undertaken as part of a task from Innomatics Research Labs.

# Project Overview
  This project involves a comprehensive data analysis on the Electric Vehicle dataset. Using Python, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and identified patterns. Additionally, I created visualizations, including a Choropleth Map and Racing Bar Plot, to showcase trends and growth of EVs based on geographical location and make over time.

# Dataset
  The dataset can be downloaded from the link provided in the task description. It contains data on electric vehicles with features such as location, make, and year. Please download and save it as ev_dataset.csv in the main project directory.

# Tasks
# Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
    * For EDA, I performed both Univariate and Bivariate analyses:
    # Univariate Analysis: Analyzed single variables, visualizing their distributions with histograms, box plots, and count plots.
    # Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between two variables using scatter plots, heatmaps, and pair plots.

# Task 2: Choropleth Map
  * Using plotly.express, I created a Choropleth Map to show the distribution of EVs based on location. This provides a visual representation of EV density across different regions, making it easy to spot high and low concentration areas.

# Task 3: Racing Bar Plot
  * I created an animated Racing Bar Plot that displays the counts of EVs by make over time, highlighting changes in popularity and market share across different years. The animation is made using Plotly, and it provides an engaging way to observe trends over time.

# Installation
  To run this project, you need Python and several packages. You can install the required packages with the following commands:
  * pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
  * import bar_chart_race as bcr
  * for plotly express: ! pip install plotly
  * for Racing Bar Plot: ! pip install bar-chart-race

# Results
  You can view the following outputs from the analysis:
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A detailed breakdown of trends and patterns.
  * Choropleth Map: Displays the geographic distribution of EVs.
  * Racing Bar Plot: Visualizes changes in EV popularity over time.
